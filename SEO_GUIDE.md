# Alba Banquet Hall - SEO Mastery Guide

This guide outlines the critical steps you need to take outside of the code to maximize your Google rankings. I have already optimized the website's code (metadata, keywords, structured data, sitemap), but SEO is 50% code and 50% "off-page" work.

## 1. Google Search Console (Critical)
This is your command center for Google Search.

1.  **Go to:** [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2.  **Add Property:** Enter your domain `albacatering.com` (Domain property is best, verifying via DNS).
3.  **Submit Sitemap:**
    *   Go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu.
    *   Enter `sitemap.xml` and submit.
    *   Google will now read all the pages and metadata I just updated.

## 2. Google Business Profile (Map Pack)
For a local business like a Banquet Hall, this is arguably **MORE important than global SEO**. This gets you on the Google Map when people search "wedding hall near me".

1.  **Claim/Create Profile:** Go to [Google Business Profile](https://www.google.com/business/).
2.  **Verify Info:** Ensure the Name "Alba Banquet Hall", Address (Phulwari Sharif), and Phone (+91-9234953085) match **exactly** what is on your website footer.
3.  **Add Photos:** Upload high-quality photos of the venue (use the ones from your Gallery page).
4.  **Get Reviews:** Ask happy customers to review you here.

## 3. Social Media & Signals
Google looks for "signals" that your business is real and active.

1.  **Consistency:** Ensure your Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube channel names and bios link back to `https://albacatering.com`.
2.  **Engagement:** Post photos from recent events and link back to your `services` or `gallery` pages.

## 4. Content Maintenance
Fresh content tells google you are active.

*   **Gallery:** Keep updating the Gallery page with real wedding photos.
*   **Reviews:** If you get new text reviews, ask the developer to add them to the website.

## 5. Analytics
To see who is visiting your site.

1.  **Google Analytics 4 (GA4):** Create an account.
2.  **Get Measurement ID:** It starts with `G-XXXXXXX`.
3.  **Ask Developer:** Send this ID to your developer to add to the site code (it takes 2 minutes).

## Summary of Code Improvements Made
I have already performed the following technical SEO upgrades:
*   ✅ **Meta Titles & Descriptions:** Optimized for "Banquet Hall Patna" and related high-traffic keywords.
*   ✅ **Structured Data (JSON-LD):** Added "LocalBusiness", "Organization", and "Service" schemas so google understands your business data (price, location, rating) deeply.
*   ✅ **Sitemap & Robots:** Fixed all links to point to `albacatering.com` and your specific service pages.
*   ✅ **Performance:** Images are optimized for fast loading (Core Web Vitals).
*   ✅ **Semantic HTML:** Correct use of Headings (H1, H2) for keyword structure.
